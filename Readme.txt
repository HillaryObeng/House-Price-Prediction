This repository holds machine learning end-to-end project from the book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (Aurelion Geron)' I personally used this book as my guide to understanding machine learning. It came in as a handy resource in more then one appreciable way. On you're journey, i hope it meets you're needs. If you like this, make it felt and i am open to comments and collaborations.

Thank you.
